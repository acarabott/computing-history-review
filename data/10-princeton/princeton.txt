Computers in Our World

Course Summary

 Computers, computing, and many things enabled by them are all around
us.  Some of this is highly visible, like laptops, phones, tablets and the
Internet; much is invisible, like the computers in gadgets and
appliances and cars, or the programs that fly our planes and keep our
telephones and power systems and medical equipment working, or the
myriad systems that quietly collect, share and sometimes leak
vast amounts of personal data about us.

 Even though most people will not be directly involved with creating
such systems, everyone is strongly affected by them.  COS 109 is
intended to provide a broad high level understanding of how computer
hardware, software, networks, and systems operate.  Topics will be
motivated by current events and concerns, and will include discussion of
how computers are built and operate; what programming is and why it is
hard; how the Internet and the Web operate; and how all of these affect
security, privacy, property and other issues.  We will also touch on
fundamental ideas from computer science, and some of the inherent
limitations of computers.

 This course is meant for humanities and social sciences students who
want to understand how computers and communications systems work and how
they affect the world we live in.  No prior experience with computers is
assumed, and there are no prerequisites.  COS 109 satisfies the QR
requirement.

 The labs are complementary to the lectures, though intended to
reinforce the basic ideas.  They will cover a spectrum of practical
applications; two of the labs are a gentle introduction to programming
in Javascript.

 The course will have fundamentally the same structure as in previous
years, but lectures, case studies and examples change every year
according to what's happening.  Stunning amounts of our private lives
are observed and recorded by business and governments, mostly without our
knowledge, let alone consent.  Major companies like Apple, Google,
Microsoft and Amazon are duking it out with each other on technical and
legal fronts, and with a variety of governments.  Skirmishes in the
forever war between students and the entertainment industry affect
Princeton students all the time.  The careless, the clueless, the
courts, the congress, and the criminal continue to do bad things with
technology.  What could possibly go wrong?  Come and find out.

  Syllabus



This will evolve over the semester, so check it out from time to time.

 Week 0: Sep 16:       
Warmup 


 Reading:  A famous 1945 Atlantic Monthly article by Vannevar Bush,
 As we may think,
is often cited as predicting the Internet and the web.  This page links
to
 a version with 
 original illustrations.
Think about how Bush's "Memex" relates to Google and your computer, and
ask yourself what Bush got right and what he totally missed.

 Week 1: Sep 21, 23:       
What's in a computer 

Problem set 1, due Sep 28

Reading:  Chapter 1 of D is for Digital: what's in a computer?

 (1) The Computer History Museum site has a lot of interesting
material, including descriptions of
 Babbage's mechanical computers.

of information.

(1) 
Preliminary discussion of the logical design of an electronic computing
instrument.  Original article by Burks, Goldstine and von Neumann.
The first page is a clear description of how computers are
organized, though in archaic terminology.  There's no need to read much
beyond that, though section 3 is also quite germane.  There is also a
good online talk on
 early computing 
 at Princeton by George Dyson.

(2) Sections 4 and 5 of Alan Turing's  famous essay on whether machines can think,
 
 Computing machinery and intelligence,
provide an alternative description of how machines operate, not so
detailed as von Neumann's.


 Week 3: Oct 5, 7:       
What the components are and how they are made 





Reading: Chapter 3 of D is for Digital: Inside the CPU
 (1) The original article on
Moore's Law.
How Stuff Works has some pages on 
microprocessors.

 Week 5: Oct 19, 21:       
	Languages, programming; Javascript





Reading:  Chapter 5 of D is for Digital: Programs and programming languages
 (1) A number of Javascript tutorials, out of many:
Codecademy,
Khan Academy, 
Javascript Kit.  
You should also look at 
Code.org if programming interests you.


 Week 6: Oct 26, 28:       
	Operating systems, file systems, databases.



Reading:  Chapter 6 of D is for Digital: Software systems

 [fall break] 

 Week 7: Nov 9, 11:       
	Javascript. Applications. 





Reading:  Chapter 7 of D is for Digital: Javascript
 (1) These articles describe some of the realities of software development:
 A Bug and a Crash, 
by James Gleick (who has written
numerous other fine technical articles--see the sidebar on this link);
 the Therac-25 accidents
(long and scary);
 a Mars Rover software problem (more technical, recent).
Skim these and think about the many computer systems that we rely on.

 (2)  Browse this
 Study of NJ voting machine problems,
a troubling place to encounter the problems of software development, and
hope that nothing could possibly go wrong in an election year.



 Week 8: Nov 16, 18:       
	Networks & communications, Internet





Reading:  Chapters 8 and 9 of D is for Digital: Networking; The Internet
 (1) Skim some of the
Internet history papers.
 (2) Check out Ed Felten's explanation of net neutrality.


 Week 9: Nov 23:        Threats; security and privacy 

No problem set or lab this week.

Reading:  Chapter 11 of D is for Digital: Data, information and privacy

 Surveillance self-defense,
and ACM Queue has a good article on 
 Communications surveillance.
 (2) James Fallows has a great article on 
 identity theft in The Atlantic.

 (3) Ed Felten's Freshman Assembly talk (9/9/12):
 
  TMI: Information, Identity, and Privacy


 Week 10: Nov 30, Dec 2:       
	 World Wide Web 





Reading:  Chapter 10 of D is for Digital: The world wide web

 Week 11: Dec 7, 9:       
	 Cryptography; Compression & error detection.



Reading: 
Good book chapter on public key cryptography.


 Week 12: Dec 14, 16:       
	 Intellectual property.  Case studies.  Wrapup 

No more labs or problem sets!

Reading: 
 (1) The Chilling
Effects Clearinghouse is an excellent, authoritative site dealing
with the legal issues around free speech, intellectual property, and online activities.
 The Electronic Frontier Foundation
also has good coverage of these issues.  
There's a good
 article on software patents in the Economist.
Finally, Your Rights Online at Slashdot
points to numerous stories about online rights.

 (2)  The 
original technical paper describing Google.  Skip the hard bits,
but get the insights.  Note the comments about advertising in Appendix A.

Administrative Information


Professor:

David Dobkin,
419 CS Building, 609-258-9907,
dpd@cs.princeton.edu.
Office hours are tentatively Tuesday and Thursday 3:00-4:00, or by appointment,
or just drop in if my door is open.


Teaching Assistants: 
   Nayana Prasad Nagendra (nagendra@cs.princeton.edu),  CS 226, Thursday 4:00-5:00
   Yichen Chen (yichenc@cs.princeton.edu), CS 313,  Wednesday 4:30-5:30


Lectures:
Tuesday and Thursday, 1:30-2:50, !!!



 Regular class attendance is expected and class participation
helps.  Frequent absences are grounds for a failing grade regardless of
other performance.


Please, no laptops, phones or tablets
except for taking notes and other class purposes.  
Regrettably, computers and phones appear to be primarily used for email,
chat, YouTube, Twitter, Google, solitaire, 2048, poker, eBay, Facebook, and
similarly compelling diversions, all of which distract you, your
neighbors, and me.  (Additions to this list are welcome)


Textbook and Readings:

 The text for the course is
 D is for Digital, 
available at Labyrinth and Amazon.

Notes and readings will be posted online.
The weekly readings beyond the text are for background, context, general education,
and/or entertainment; you are not expected to know the detailed
content, but you should understand the basic ideas.  Anything in
the text is fair game.

Check out the bibliography for other
suggestions.


Problem sets:

 Eight or nine weekly problem sets, together worth about 20 percent of the
course grade, will be assigned.  Problems are intended to be
straightforward, reinforcing material covered in class and providing
practice in quantitative reasoning, and should take 1-2 hours to
complete.

Problem sets will be due by 5:00 PM
Monday, one week after they are assigned.  Turn in
solutions in the box outside room 419 on the fourth floor of the CS
building, or at the beginning of class.  

Labs:

 There will be eight labs to give hands-on practice in important
aspects of computing.  The labs are designed to be easily completed
within three hours, if you have read through the instructions
beforehand, which should take at most an hour.  You can do the labs
wherever you want -- in your dorm room, in campus clusters, ... -- but
if you need assitance, there will be undergrad lab TAs available in 
the clusters in rooms 121 and 122 Lewis.  These lab TAs will be there
Monday through Friday from 7--11PM, Saturday from 2--8PM and Sunday from 5--11PM.

Labs are together worth about 20 percent of the course grade.  To
receive credit, students must complete labs by 1159PM Friday of the week they are assigned.

 Labs will start the second full week of classes.  There will be no
labs in the week before fall break, Thanksgiving week, or the last week
of classes.


Lateness Policy:

 In fairness to everyone, only minimal credit can be given for
late submissions unless there are extraordinary circumstances, and in no
case after solutions have been posted or discussed in class.

 For both labs and problem sets, extracurricular activities and
heavy workloads in other classes don't count as "extraordinary", no
matter how unexpected or important or time-consuming.  And I am
unsympathetic to the appeal that "this is my fifth class," since the
same could be said of any one of your other classes.

 Nevertheless, everyone gets truly behind from time to time.  In
recognition of this, you are allowed two late submissions (no more than
4 days late in each case).  You must let us know ahead of time that
you will be submitting late so we can keep track.

 You must turn in all problem sets and labs to pass the course.



Collaboration Policy:

 You are encouraged to collaborate on problem sets, but you must turn in
separate solutions; the names of all collaborators must appear on each
submission.  

 (This elaboration of the policy on collaboration is paraphrased from
COS 126:) You must reach your own understanding of the problem and
discover a path to its solution.  During this time, discussions with
friends are encouraged.  However, when the time comes to write down the
solution to the problem, such discussions are no longer appropriate --
the solution must be your own work, so you must work on the written
assignment on your own.  If you have a question, you can certainly ask
friends or teaching assistants, but do not, under any circumstances,
copy another person's work or present it as your own.  This is a
violation of
 academic regulations,
for which the penalties are draconian.

 Another way to look at this: If I ask you to explain how you got
your answer, you will have no trouble doing so, because you understand
the material completely.

 As it is for problem sets, so it is for labs: collaboration to
understand the material is encouraged, but the work you turn in has
to be your own.


Examinations:

 There may well be short, unannounced, in-class quizzes to verify
your existence and test your understanding.  These could be worth 5-10
percent of the course grade.  

 A take-home, open-book midterm examination will be given during the
week before fall break.  It will cover material presented and discussed
in class and any relevant reading through the end of the fifth week of
classes.  It will be worth 20 percent of the course grade.

 An open-book final examination will be given during the January exam
period.  It will cover all material presented and discussed in class
throughout the semester and any relevant reading.  It will be worth
35-40 percent of the course grade.

 There will be a question and answer session before each exam.  These
are not meant to be an orderly review and are not a substitute for
missed lectures, but they are a chance for you to ask questions about
course material.

 Sorry: no collaboration on take-home exams or the final.


Comments on Grades:

 If you do poorly on the midterm but much better on the final exam, I
will weight the final more heavily than usual, so a poor midterm grade
is not fatal at all.  But you must do acceptably well on the final;
students who cannot answer even half the questions should not be
surprised to get a D, and an F is not impossible, especially if other
work is also inadequate.

 Don't forget that P/D/F has three possible outcomes, only one of
which is good.  Attending lectures, paying attention, participating,
turning work in on time, coming to office hours, studying for exams, and
attending Q/A sessions all help to avoid unpleasant results.
