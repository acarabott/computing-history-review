    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p class="text-left">Section B:DESCRIPTION: This course will explore research topics in physically based character animation, where the goal is to obtain a character performance that appears both natural and physically plausible. In particular, we will investigate how the physical properties of a character such as range of motion, weight distribution, and level of coordination constrain and suggest plausible motions for that character. We will explore theory and advances in motion controllers, strengths and limitations of motion optimization algorithms, opportunities for fast physics algorithms for interactive applications, the nature of natural motion and aspects of motion style. In addition to computer graphics literature, we will search biomechanics, human motor control, and evolutionary biology literature for insights obtained from these fields. The course should be appropriate for graduate students with some computer graphics and / or robotics experience and for advanced undergraduates who have taken 15-462 or equivalent.    Section J: DESCRIPTION: The world around us is comprised of three-dimensional geometry: from the cars we drive and the clothes we wear, to the food we eat and the organs in our bodies.  To a large extent, our ability to make sense of the world is therefore limited by our capacity to design, process, and analyze geometric data.  The field of discrete differential geometry (DDG) applies ideas from smooth differential geometry to computational algorithms for analyzing and manipulating real-world geometric data.  This course serves as a first course on differential geometry that treats both smooth and discrete objects from a single unified point of view.  Emphasis will be on both rigorous analysis and real-world implementation of numerical algorithms.  Prerequisites: linear algebra, vector calculus.
