    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p class="text-left">Truth, Justice, and Algorithms is an interdisciplinary course that covers selected theoretical topics at the interface of computer science and economics, focusing on the algorithmic side of incentives and fairness.   The courses topics include: computational social choice, e.g., voting rules as maximum likelihood estimators, the axiomatic approach to ranking systems and crowdsourcing, manipulation of elections and ways to circumvent it; cooperative games, focusing on solution concepts such as the core and the Shapley value, and their computation; fair division algorithms for allocating divisible and indivisible goods, and approximate notions of fairness; online matching algorithms (competitive analysis, not dating) and kidney exchange; noncooperative games, including Nash equilibrium and correlated equilibrium, their computation, connections to learning theory, Stackelberg security games, and the price of anarchy in congestion and routing games; and topics in social networks such as the diffusion of technologies and influence maximization.  NOTE: This course is cross-listed with 15-896. Undergraduates may enroll into 15-896 but be aware of work load difference. The two courses are identical in terms of lectures, content, and homework assignments. The only difference is in the final project requirement. In 483, students will prepare a summary of several papers -- this will require 10-20 hours of work. In 896, students will carry out a research project with the goal of obtaining novel results, and present their results in class -- a good project will require 50-60 hours of work. Also note that 483 is 9 units, and 896 is 12 units.</p>
