    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p class="text-left">The course will cover a fairly wide range of topics in algorithm design. Some of the topics will be quite a bit older work from the 1960s to more recent work from this century. We hope to present as many different tools and algorithms as time permits. Most topics will be covered in two phases. In the first we will cover an important design technique by presenting a classic possibly simple application. In the second, an application will be presented that hopefully will be one that is new to most of the class. By the end of the class students are expected to be able to recognize which tool or method to apply to a problem and reasonably proficient at using this tool. We also feel that the student should be able to explain their algorithmic design idea to their piers and supervisors both in writing and orally. This is why we require both written and oral presentations of homework. Please check the preliminary schedule for an idea of the possible topics to be covered. The schedule at this point is mostly a list of topics covered some five years ago. The schedule will be updated with several newer topics.   Please refer to https://www.cs.cmu.edu/csd-grad/courseschedules16.html for the most recent schedule updates.</p>
