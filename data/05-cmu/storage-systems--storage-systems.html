    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p class="text-left">Storage systems are among the most fascinating and the most important parts of computer systems. They often dominate the performance of a system, and their components inner workings require amazing feats of engineering. At the same time, storage systems hold the crown jewels of most organizations: their information (from source code to Microsofts software to the sales databases of every e-commerce site). Within the field of computer systems and computer engineering, there is no area whose demand for bright people and better solutions is more robust.   This course will cover the design, implementation, and use of storage systems, from the characteristics and operation of individual storage devices to the OS, database, and networking approaches involved in tying them together and making them useful. Along the way, we will examine several case studies of real systems, demands placed on storage systems by important applications, and impacts of trends and emerging technologies on future storage systems.   For those familiar with 18-316 (Intro. to Data Storage Systems Technology) and 18-517 (Data Storage Systems Design Project): one should consider these courses as distinct and complementary, with neither being a pre-requisite to the other. 18-316 and 18-517 focus on the low-level technologies (magnetics, materials, applied physics, etc.) whereas 746 focuses on storages incorporation and role in computer systems.     Pre-requisite of 15-213, 15-513, or 18-213 - Grade of B- or better.  Please refer to http://www.cs.cmu.edu/csd-grad/courseschedulef16.html for the most recent schedule updates.</p>
